I have only been an Obsidian user for about 4 months. My PKM + primary tool for thought has been exclusively Notion for about 3 years. I was starting to find Notion limiting when it came to a PKM so I looked for alternatives. After learning that Obsidian was based on local storage I had to give it a try. After a day of use I was hooked. I found the simplicity of markdown and local files so refreshing. It works really well for my dyslexia too. Being able to toggle to source/ preview mode makes it really dynamic for my needs. 

I have found [[Danny Hatcher]] videos extremely useful when it comes to the technical and theoretical uses of Obsidian. Looking forward to contribute to this project in any way possible.
