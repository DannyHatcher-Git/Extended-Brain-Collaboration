I am a recently retired university professor, who held a joint appointment in the departments of cognitive science and religious studies.

My research interests:
	- cognitive science: cognition and culture, especially cognitive science of religion and cognition and morality (I note also that like others of you here on Internet Academics, I have a strong interest in embodied/extended cognition and the cognitive science of learning)
	- religious studies: Buddhism, with a specialty in early Japanese Buddhism

I have been using Obsidian for over two years. This usage has peaked my interest in personal knowledge management (PKM). One of my retrement goals is to effectively devise a PKM system that will let me experiment with short-form writing intended for a more general audience.

Finally, I am happy to join you all in the effort to figure out using Obsidian as a collaborative research tool. Thanks, [[Danny Hatcher|Danny]], for setting this in motion!
