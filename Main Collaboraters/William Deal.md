**I updated this intro file on 2022-10-23, but now what I wrote is gone. I can re-do this page, but the more concerning issue is why this data was lost.**

**UPDATE (2022-10-25): I created a separate file titled Data Loss and it is now missing, too. Is there some issue with the settings at my end?** 

[[Danny Hatcher|I]] removed the file from notes as I want that folder to be fore articles notes rather than conversation points, those things are being done in the [[README#^discord|discord]].
