I'm Sarah Bentley (Arminta). I'm a futures trader and I have a slight obsession with tracking, well, everything. I've worked my way through the various note taking apps over the years (Evernote, Notion, Roam, Logseq, Obsidian, Tana, etc...)

I just had a baby girl so I'm not as active in the community as I was the past few years. Currently reevaluating why, how, when, where and what I take notes on. Finding my priorities shifting and things that were once super important to me just aren't anymore. 

I'm big into data, dataview, quantified self, excel type stuff, metadata. I'm currently doing a big vault refactor with the Metadata Menu plugin to try to see how much I can replicate Tana-style metadata management. I actually think that type of consistent metadata templating is vital for collab, so might be helpful here?

This my first time doing any sort of collaboration so I don't know what I'm doing............ ðŸ¤ª

(Of course everything is orange lol, it's going to burn my eyes out!)
