> [!NOTE] About Me
> Hello! I'm the other half of the PKM Podcast which I host with [[Danny Hatcher]] (which is always a laugh). Outside of that I'm a business & systems consultant (which I summarise as a "[Simplicity Specialist]( https://simplicity-specialist.com/ )") where I help business owners designs systems that fit their brain, basically using elements of Gestalt Psychology, Ecological Dynamics (because of course) to help support clients to design things that fit them and their brain. I primarily work with people with ADHD, Autism or other forms of "neurodiversity" - but as my focus is on the individual, it's tailored 😁    

I've spent quite a few years in the business space, so I "know how it works" - so a lot of what I'll probably provide in this space is business related content, because it's what I do well... I'm super excited to create business content that links to actual psychology research with a hollistic approach :)
