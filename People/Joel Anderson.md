> 2022-10-21: Currently on vacation, but I wanted to get the ball rolling on this.

I'm Professor of Moral Psychology & Social Philosophy and Director, Ethics Institute, 
Department of Philosophy & Religious Studies, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.  

I'm very interested in tools of thought more generally, and share interests with [[Danny Hatcher]] in the notion of [[extended cognition]].
I'm currently part of the leadership of a major interuniversity research consortium on the "Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies":  [ESDiT web page](esdit.nl).

In that context, I've been spearheading the development of an Obsidian vault that integrates information about the 60+ researchers – their interests and specializations – and about specific research collaborations.  My grandest ambition, however, is to set this up as a way of integrating literature notes, reports on project group internal discussions, an "ontology" of key concepts, and notes that articulate contributions to answering several key research questions.   

I tried to run this in June using the collaborative function Obsidian "Publish," but this was a complete disaster.  At this point, we've ordered Obsidian Sync account for 30 key users, but I'm still rolling that it.  It's quite expensive.

## Answers to [[Danny Hatcher]]'s #question s

#answer/JoelAnderson: These are not synced between users.  So, if you want to be sure that everyone at least starts out with a shared set of settings, it's good to provide instructions for that – or send a ZIP file with the full vault. ^vxyjo9
