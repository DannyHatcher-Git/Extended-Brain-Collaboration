# Extended-Brain-Collab

Welcome! This is experimental vault exploring collaborative research in Obsidian.

This uses the collaborative sync feature, and the Obsidian Git plugin.

**NOTE**: Editing on the same page as someone else doesn't work well.

# Contributing

Reach out to [Danny Hatcher](https://twitter.com/DannyHatcher) if you have a sync account, so you can be added to the vault.

Each contributer can create a page for their own notes and doodles for working.
